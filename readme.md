# Sitemap for better SEO

There is already a post on this website (you can find it in the archive) about using [Bard](https://github.com/laravelista/Bard) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) to create a sitemap. It contains some cool ways of adding dynamic links, multilungual links, named routes, sitemap index etc.

**In this lesson I will focus only on the core objective and that is a simple, plain sitemap with static urls.**

This kind of sitemap required only a few minutes to set up, but it can increase your search engine standing a lot.
